Tuned for Yang's bidisperse system.  

This is current “tuned” for Yang’s bidisperse system, meaning you’ll need to match it back up to your Pa0 and parameters (such as system size and color scheme).  This version resizes the particles since Yang has a bidisperse system.  There is a key parameter right at the top of the file currently set to 

get_data=1

this means that python will suck in the ascii files one by one, which is one of the most inefficient parts of the process.  Once you’ve run the code once, you should have twice the number of files with the python binary file handle “.npy” instead of the original extension free name.  Then you can change “get_data” to zero, and it will read the .npy files instead.  Basically it is writing a python formatted binary of the arrays you stored the first time you loaded the files.  The read/writes of binary files is faster, so this happens faster.

Next improvement, it doesn’t completely redraw the frame every time.  Instead it updates the particle positions (the other parameters such as size can also be updated).  This is much faster too.
